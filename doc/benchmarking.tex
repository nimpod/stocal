For each algorithm and model, figures show:
\begin{itemize}
\item The large graph taking up the first two rows shows the relationship between the number of reactions
(y-axis) and the algorithm runtime (x-axis) of every individual simulation repetition. The RPS value is 
calculated from these two metrics, and is colour coded from red (bad RPS) to yellow (decent RPS) to 
green (good RPS) relative for each unique alg \& model combination.

\item The first smaller plot located in the bottom left plots the frequency distribution of RPS values.

\item The second smaller plot located in the bottom center plots the frequency distribution of the number of reactions.

\item The third smaller plot located in the bottom right plots the frequency distribution of the algorithm runtime.

\end{itemize}
